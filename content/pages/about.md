Jesus Youth is an international Catholic movement that challenges young people to live a meaningful, creative and fulfilling life. This life begins with a personal, loving encounter with Jesus and continues as they grow in a ***joyful spirituality ***within a community of like-minded friends. Each person in the movement is called to live the faith every day by sharing the Good News in today’s diverse environments and by carrying the mission of the Church to the peripheries of our world. Jesus Youth is approved by the Holy See as an *international private association of the faithful with juridical personality.*

#### The Journey

In the mid-1970s the flame of the Charismatic Renewal spread to India and to Kerala, the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent. The wave of the Holy Spirit gave rise to several youth groups where catholic youth encountered Jesus and the Gospel in a renewed and refreshing way. Gradually these groups began to connect to each other and in 1985, these youth groups came together for a large conference. The conference was called ‘Jesus Youth 85’ and the young people who attended the conference began to call themselves ‘Jesus Youth’.

These young people shared their experiences with those around, and as they moved into universities, schools, workplaces and cities, they continued to spread the exciting news of Jesus - forming prayer groups and cell groups. The spirituality, approach and creativity of the young people began to spread as a lifestyle. As many among them travelled to different countries, they carried their Jesus Youth lifestyle along with them, leading to the formation of Jesus Youth groups around the world.

Though the movement began in the Southern part of India, the Jesus Youth way of life resonated among diverse cultures and the movement spread to the Middle East, Europe, South East Asia, US, Australia and Africa in a short span of time. Through migration and mission, Jesus Youth groups were reaching out to local cultures in different parts of the world. Today Jesus Youth groups have a local presence in over 25 countries and are spreading out into new cultural and geographical spaces around the world.
